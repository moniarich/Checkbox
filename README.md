# Checkbox

Checkbox conditions:

- if 'A' is checked then 'B' and 'C' are disabled
- if 'B' is checked then you can check 'A' or 'C' but if you checked first 'C' then 'A' is disabled but if you checked 'A' first you can also check 'C' next
- similar to the above: if 'C' is checked then you can check 'A' or 'B' but if you checked 'B' first then 'A' is disabled but if you checked 'A' first you can also check 'B' next
